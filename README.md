# TodoList
A simple, single-page website for making todo list from Sean Pelling's JS tutorial on Udemy. The user can enter in any number of items in the bottom bar and add that item to the list. The top bar allows the user to search through the list for a todo item, removing unrelated items as the user types in keywords. You can remove items from the list by clicking the trash can icon to the side of each entry.
